* Create appropriate metadata to describe a new work

## Open repositories

Open science and [FAIR principles](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples)
encourage scholars to put more of their content online in an open format.
Scholarly works can be added online repositories that centralize, store, and
share the results.  Most repositories will be associated with a DOI
Registration Agency and will generate DOIs for every item that is stored.
Generating a DOI is one factor that you can use to determine whether a
repository is trustworthy. 

The NIST library creates and registers two types of DOIs – data DOIs and publication DOIs.   
NIST uses DataCite as the registration agency for data DOIs. DataCite DOIs are created when a record of research data is published through NIST’s MIDAS system.  NIST uses CrossRef as the registration agency for publication DOIs, such as those for Journal of Research of NIST articles, NISTIRs, and Special Publications. 

### Domain-specific repositories

There are many repositories that focus on a specific type of data or data from
a certain field.   A subject-specific repository can collect data from
researchers around the world and customize the way the data is displayed.  This
can make it easier to find and reuse the data.  One challenge for
domain-specific repositories is ensuring a consistent source of funding-you
should monitor the repositories you use to ensure that your data remains
available.  

You can find a good listing of subject-specific repositories at
[PLOS](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories).  
A more complete list of repositories is available at [re3data](http://www.re3data.org)

### Institutional repositories

Many institutions host data repositories, often through the library, to preserve the data collected at the
institution.  These repositories are often general and can take any scholarly
works that are associated with the institution.  Because these repositories are
associated with an institution, they may have a more consistent source of
funding.  However, they often do not have the customization available in a
domain-specific repository.

An example of an institutional data repository is
[NIST Science Data Portal](https://data.nist.gov)

### General repositories

A number of general repositories exist that can collect any type of scholarly
output.  These can be associated with a publisher, like 
[Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/) or
[Figshare](https://figshare.com/).  Some institutions also run general
repositories that are open to all, like the 
[Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/), 
[Dryad](http://datadryad.org/), or
[Zenodo](https://www.zenodo.org/). These general repositories can be free 
(Mendeley Data, Harvard Dataverse, Zenodo), charge per submission (Dryad),
or have size limitations (Figshare). 


### Sample DOI 


#### Basic Information

- Authors and their ORCID ids
- Title and subtitle
- Date of publication
- Report number
- DOI
- URL of publication


#### Access and Licensing

[NIST Copyright, Fair Use, and Licensing statement](https://www.nist.gov/open/copyright-fair-use-and-licensing-statements-srd-data-software-and-technical-series-publications)

#### Organizational and Funding Identifiers

Organizational identifiers for NIST

- 10.13039/100000161 (FundRef id)
- https://ror.org/05xpvk416 (ROR id)

#### Related Identifiers

Related identifiers are a way to connect different works together.  This paper is a supplement to another [publication](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.7854), 
so that DOI is added in the metadata as "isSupplementTo" as the relationship.
